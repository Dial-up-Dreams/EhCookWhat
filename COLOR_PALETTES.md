## 🏆 Final Recommendation: Clean & Modern (Palette 2)

### Justification:

**1. Readability (★★★★★)**
- Excellent contrast between #212121 text and #FAFAFA background
- Clean, modern typography stands out clearly
- Golden orange buttons pop without being jarring

**2. Warmth & Food Appeal (★★★★★)**
- Golden orange is one of the most appetizing colours (think: golden fried foods, caramelization)
- Green suggests freshness and health, balancing indulgence with wellness
- The combination evokes "fresh ingredients meeting hot wok" – perfect for cooking

**3. Modern Yet Approachable (★★★★★)**
- Avoids clichéd red-and-gold Chinese stereotypes
- Feels contemporary and user-friendly (appealing to young adults and working professionals)
- Professional enough to build trust, casual enough to be inviting

**4. Psychological Impact**
- Green: Growth, freshness, harmony, balance

**5. Differentiation**
- Most Chinese food websites use red/gold schemes
- This palette stands out while still feeling food-appropriate
- Memorable and unique identity

### Why Not the Others?

**Warm & Homely (Palette 1):**
- Could feel too intense with the deep red-orange
- Might be harder to maintain readability with warmer backgrounds
- Risk of feeling "old-fashioned" or "heavy"

**Traditional Chinese-Inspired (Palette 3):**
- Too conventional – many Chinese restaurants use this scheme
- May reinforce stereotypes rather than modernize the space
- Could feel formal when the brand wants to be "friendly and approachable"
